# What is this?
This is a program that will generate a slide puzzle 
based on an image description.

# How does it work?
The code uses the beautifulsoup api to get images from a
google image search of the description the user inputs. From there
it will shuffle the tiles around and make a slide puzzle with that image

# How do I use it?
1) Install python and pip
2) CD into the project directory and run pip install -r requirements.txt
3) Execute the main.py script 
4) Input the description of the image you want a slide puzzle for
5) Enjoy!

Thank you for checking out my project!
